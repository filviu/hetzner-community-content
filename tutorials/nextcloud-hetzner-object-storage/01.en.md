## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to setup Nextcloud on a Hetzner Cloud Server using Docker and the Hetzner Object Storage as a storage backend. The advantages of using an Object Storage as oposed to a bigger cloud server or a big volume is that you don't have to reserve and pay for capacity in advance and it can grow organically.

Nextcloud administration is a big topic, this tuorial will focus on using the Hetzner Object Storage as a backend and start a regular installation. This can be improved and extended by following the official Nextcloud documentation at [https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/).

The docker images we will be using are further documented here: [https://github.com/nextcloud/docker](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker)

**Prerequisites**

* A Hetzner Cloud account with Hetzner Object Storage activated
* A Hetzner Cloud project
* A domain you want to use for your Nextcloud instance (e.g. nextcloud.example.com) ideally with its DNS hosted with Hetzner.

**Example terminology**

* Server IP: <server-ip> - the ip of the server you will be ordering. 


## Step 1 - Create Object Storage Bucket

Navigate to Object Stoarage and click **Create bucket**. Give it a name, preferably a random uuid, like one returned by running `uuidgen`. Make sure it is set to Private and click **Create & Buy now**. We will refer to this bucket as <object-storage-bucket-name> in the following steps.

Click on the name of the freshly created bucket, navigate to **Manage credentials** and click **Generate credential**. Give the set a descriptive name e.g. `nextcloud` then click "Create". Save them in a secure place (e.g. your password manager) as they are not retrievable once the popup is closed.

Further on we  will reffer to those credentials as <object-storage-access-key> and <object-storage-secret-key>.


## Step 2 - Create Hetzner Cloud Server 

Login to your Hetzner Cloud account, navigate to the project you want to use then **Servers**. Select **Apps->Docker CE** and select an appropriate machine size for your Nextcloud instance preferably from the same location as your Storage Bucket. Don't select the machine size based on root disk size, we won't be using that for data storage, just RAM and CPU. 

Check the **Private networks** checkbox and **Create Network**. Name it appropriately, e.g. `network-nextcloud`, choose an IP range e.g. `10.2.0.0/16` and click **Create network**. 

Select or add your ssh public key.

Select or create an appropriate firewall. If you will be following the optional step of adding a Load Balancer you can deny access from everywhere except SSH from your location.

Click "Create & Buy Now"

## Step 3 - Deploy Nextcloud

SSH to your server `ssh root@<server-ip>`.

Create a directory for your docker compose files and folders for the persistent storage of the nextcloud containers 

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/nextcloud/redis
mkdir -p /opt/nextcloud/compose
```

### Step 3.1 - Create deployment and configuration files 

`vim /opt/nextcloud/compose/compose.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.6
    restart: always
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW
    volumes:
      - "/opt/nextcloud/mysql:/var/lib/mysql"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_HOST=db
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${NC_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${NC_MYSQL_PASSWORD}
  mysqlbackup:
    image: selim13/automysqlbackup:2.7.0
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - "/opt/nextcloud/mysql-backups:/backup"
    environment:
      CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 */4 * * *"
      USERNAME: "root"
      PASSWORD: "${NC_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}"
      DBHOST: "db"
      DBEXCLUDE: "performance_schema information_schema"
      EXTRA_OPTS: "--single-transaction"
    depends_on:
      - db
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - app
    volumes:
      - "/opt/nextcloud/redis:/data"
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_HOST_PORT=6379
    entrypoint: redis-server /data/redis.conf
  app:
    image: nextcloud:30
    restart: always
    environment:
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=admin
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_HOST=db
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${NC_MYSQL_PASSWORD}
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_HOST_PORT=6379
      - REDIS_HOST_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
      - PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G
      - PHP_UPLOAD_LIMIT=15G
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_BUCKET=${OBJECTSTORE_S3_BUCKET}
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_HOST=${OBJECTSTORE_S3_HOST}
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_KEY=${OBJECTSTORE_S3_KEY}
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_SECRET=${OBJECTSTORE_S3_SECRET}
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_SSL=true
      - OBJECTSTORE_S3_PORT=443
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "/opt/nextcloud/html:/var/www/html"
      - "/opt/nextcloud/redis/redis-session.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/redis-session.ini"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

Notes for the compose file above:

- it includes automysqlbackup in order to generate database regular snaphots. If you use different backup methotds you might want to remove it
- it uses the major version tag of the nextcloud docker image - 30 at the time of editing. This means it will update to whatever 30.x.x versions will be released but will require you to actively change it to 31, etc. when a next major version lands. This is by design, major version upgrades might need migration steps.

Create an `.env` file and add the following variables:

`vim /opt/nextcloud/compose/.env`:

```ini
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=nextcloud

NC_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql_securepass
NC_MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysql_pass

REDIS_PASSWORD=redispass

NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=ncpass

OBJECTSTORE_S3_HOST=fsn1.your-objectstorage.com
OBJECTSTORE_S3_BUCKET=<object-storage-bucket-name>
OBJECTSTORE_S3_KEY= <object-storage-access-key>
OBJECTSTORE_S3_SECRET=<object-storage-secret-key>
```

You will of course need to generate stronger passwords than the one in the .env example above.

Redis configuration files:

`vim /opt/nextcloud/redis/redis-session.ini`

```ini
session.save_handler = redis
session.save_path = "tcp://redis:6379?auth=redispass"
redis.session.locking_enabled = 1
redis.session.lock_retries = -1
redis.session.lock_wait_time = 10000
```

`vim /opt/nextcloud/redis/redis.conf`

```ini
dir /data
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
appendfsync everysec
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
requirepass "redispass"
```

**Note:** be sure to use exactly the same password for redis those two coniguration files as in the `.env` file above!

### Step 3.2 - Start Nextcloud and

```bash
cd /opt/nextcloud/compose
docker-compose up -d
```

Edit `/opt/nextcloud/html/config/config.php` to add the trusted domains, the `trusted_domains` array should be similar to:

```  'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'localhost',
    1 => '<server-ip>',
    2 => 'nextcloud.example.com',
  ),
```

In a browser navigate to http://<server-ip>/ and verify that you can login using admin and the password set in `.env`. Note: modern browsers if navigating http://something will imediately redirect to https://something if the response is note imediate. So while waiting for your containers to start you will need to re-type (paste) http://<server-ip>/ instead of hitting reload.

In your Hetzner Cloud Account navigate to your bucket and doublecheck that files have appeared after you succesfully logged in to your Nextcloud instance.

## Step 4 - Add a Hetzner Load Balancer (Op)

Navigate to **Load Balancers** and click **Create Load Balancer**. Select the size, location and select the private network created at Step 2.

For **Targets** select **Cloud Servers** and select the cloud server created at Step 2. 

Under **Services** select:

- Protocol: https
- Source port: 443
- Destination port: 80

**Add certificates** -> Create certificate. Either `nextcloud.example.com` or a wildcard certificate like `*.example.com` will do.

Click on **Create & Buy now**.

Click on your newly created load balancer, **Service** then the Edit pen-icon to set the health check advanced settings. Under Domain fill out `nextclout.example.com`. This is needed because the healthcheck is running via the private network and the private ip of your server is not among the trusted domains.

This will only work if `example.com` is configured in Hetzner DNS. If not, or you prefer something like caddy or nginx-proxy-manager you will have to adjust accordingly the way you setup SSL termination.

No matter your method it is highly reccomended to use SSL for your nextcloud instance.

## Conclusion

You are now the owner of a performant and extensible private cloud sollution that is completely open source and free from tracking by big corporations.

But with great power comes great responsibility. As mentioned in the Introduction, Nextcloud is a big topic so you are advised to consult the official documentation on further steps to improve and secure your instance. Ensuring firewall rules are correct, enabling 2FA for accounts and keeping your installation up to date are only the basics of a secure nextcloud installation.
